- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ageoghegan-ri
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in .NET software development (and pretty much any other kind loosely too)
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™ve been a Software Architect for some 25 years now.
- ğŸ“« You can't reach me via this stupid address goaway@spammers.com 
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He FFS
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like trashy SciFi and Fantasy books.  Pretty thrashy anyway.  This is in no way an indicator of my IQ.
